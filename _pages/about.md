I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge in 2023 within the <a href='https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/cca/research-cambridge-centre-analysis'>Cambridge Centre for Analysis (CCA) </a> and the <a href='https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis'>Cambridge Image Analysis (CIA)</a> group, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/95169-martin-benning'>Prof. Martin Benning</a> and <a href='https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/cbs31'>Prof. Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb </a>. My studentship was fully funded by <a href='https://www.ccimi.maths.cam.ac.uk/'> Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information</a>. From 2023 to 2025, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href='https://www.hw.ac.uk/about/our-schools/mathematical-and-computer-sciences/research/mathematical-sciences/applied-and-computational-mathematics'>School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences
</a> at Heriot-Watt University and affiliated with the <a href='https://www.maxwell.ac.uk/'>Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a>, where I worked with <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/audreyrepetti'> Prof. Audrey Repetti</a> on unfolded neural networks and plug-and-play algorithms. 

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href='https://www.hw.ac.uk/about/our-schools/engineering-and-physical-sciences/research/sensors-signals-and-systems'>Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems</a> at Heriot-Watt University, where I'm part of the <a href='https://bisc.site.hw.ac.uk/'> Bayesian Imaging, Sensing and Computation (BISC)</a> group working with <a href='https://bisc.site.hw.ac.uk/dr-yoann-altmann/'> Prof. Yoann Altmann</a> on computational imaging, statistical signal processing, and neuromorphic computing. Broadly, I am passionate about developing and integrating ideas from applied mathematics, statistics, and machine learning to create scalable, reliable, and interpretable methods for imaging and signal recovery.
