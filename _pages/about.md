I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge in 2023 within the <a href='https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/cca/research-cambridge-centre-analysis'>Cambridge Centre for Analysis</a> and the Cambridge Image Analysis Group. I received a fully funded studetship by <a href='https://www.ccimi.maths.cam.ac.uk/'> Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information</a> and was fortunate to be advised advised by Prof. Martin Benning and Prof. Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb. From 2023 to 2025, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Heriot-Watt University and the Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences, where I worked with Prof. Audrey Repetti on unfolded neural networks and plug-and-play algorithms. 

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems at Heriot-Watt University, where I work with Prof. Yoann Altmann on computational imaging, statistical signal processing, and neuromorphic computing. Broadly, I am passionate about developing and integrating ideas from applied mathematics, statistics, and machine learning to create scalable, reliable, and interpretable methods for imaging and signal recovery. 

#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture #`prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit #`_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones #below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
